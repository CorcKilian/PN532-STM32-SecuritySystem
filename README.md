# STM32 UID Authentication System Using Bare Metal Coding

A lightweight embedded NFC UID authentication system for the STM32L432 microcontroller using the PN532 NFC module (SPI mode). This project was developed with PlatformIO in VSCode using bare-metal programming techniques to gain full hardware control. The system is capable of adding, removing, and authenticating NFC tag UIDs. Extensive debugging and protocol validation have been carried out using logic analyzers, register inspection, and reference to official datasheets and user manuals.

---

## Objectives

This project aims to implement a lightweight embedded authentication system using NFC technology. The main objectives were to:

- Build a bare-metal firmware for STM32 that communicates with the PN532 NFC module.
- Authenticate tag UIDs and manage a whitelist over a UART menu.
- Validate all SPI communication and interrupt handling using hardware tools.

---

## Features

- Add, remove, and authenticate NFC tag UIDs using the PN532
- Menu-driven UART interface for user interaction
- SPI-based communication with custom command framing and ACK validation
- Clean, modular codebase with dedicated modules for SPI, NFC protocol, and hardware abstraction
- Designed for the STM32L432 but adaptable to other STM32 series
- Comprehensive debugging evidence documented via logic analyzer captures and register views

---

## Requirements

- STM32L432 development board (or similar STM32 board)
- PN532 NFC module configured for SPI mode
- PlatformIO with VSCode
- NFC tags or cards
- Serial monitor (use the one in VSCode/PlatformIO or your preferred terminal)

> **Note:** Timers, ADC/DAC were not used as they were not necessary for the scope of this NFC-based authentication system. All timing was handled by polling and logic analyzer timing where applicable. GPIOs and interrupts were extensively used instead.

## Debugging and Protocol Validation

This section documents the detailed debugging and validation process carried out during development. It includes logic analyzer captures, register inspections, and command-response verification to prove that the system behaves as expected.

### SPI Frame and Data Exchange

- **Frame Format Expected by PN532:**  
  ![Frame Format](docs/PN532_SPI_FrameFormat.png)  
  **Explanation:** We want to ensure that our command frames match the PN532 protocol. This image shows the expected format—including the preamble, start code, length, checksum, data payload, and postamble—which guides our implementation of `sendCommand()`. 

- **Detailed Frame Structure:**  
  ![Frame Format Details](docs/PN532_SPI_FrameFormat2.png)  
  **Explanation:** A detailed breakdown of the command frame’s structure. This helps verify that every byte is in the correct order and that the checksum is computed properly.

- **Correctly Formatted Frame on Logic Analyzer:**  
  ![Correct Frame on Logic Analyzer](docs/PN532_SPI_FrameFormat_LogicAnalyserExample.png)  
  **Explanation:** This capture confirms that the transmitted SPI frame complies with the PN532's expected format, ensuring reliable communication.

- **Normal SPI Data Exchange:**  
  ![Data Link Level Exchange](docs/PN532_SPI_DataLinkLevel_NormalExchange.png)  
  **Explanation:** Displays a complete SPI exchange including the command packet, the PN532’s ACK, the response packet, and the host’s optional ACK. This demonstrates end-to-end data flow.

### External Interrupt (EXTI) and Register Configuration

- **GPIO Mapping for EXTI:**  
  ![GPIO Mapping](docs/STM_EXTI_GPIOMapping.png)  
  **Explanation:** To trigger an interrupt when PB1 goes low, we first examine the GPIO mapping for external interrupts. This image shows which pins can be used for EXTI, which is essential for configuring the IRQ for the PN532.

- **EXTI Line Connections:**  
  ![EXTI Line Connections](docs/STM_EXTI_LinesConnections.png)  
  **Explanation:** This diagram shows the connection of EXTI lines across the STM32 ports, indicating configurable and non-configurable lines. It provides the context needed for setting up PB1 as the IRQ input.

- **EXTICR Register View:**  
  ![EXTICR Register](docs/STM_SYSCFG_EXTICR1.png)  
  **Explanation:** To configure the interrupt, we use the EXTI configuration register (EXTICR). This image displays the register layout, which is used to map EXTI1 to the desired port (e.g., PB1).

- **EXTICR Bit Configuration:**  
  ![EXTICR Bits](docs/STM_SYSCFG_EXTICR1_EXTI1ConfigBits.png)  
  **Explanation:** Details the bit settings required for assigning EXTI1 to the correct pin. This ensures that when PB1 goes low, an interrupt is triggered as intended.

- **Interrupt Mask Register (IMR):**  
  ![IMR Register](docs/STM_EXTI_IMR1.png)  
  **Explanation:** This image shows the interrupt mask register, which must be managed to enable or disable interrupts.

- **Rising Trigger Selection Register (RTSR):**  
  ![RTSR Register](docs/STM_EXTI_RTSR1.png)  
  **Explanation:** Configuring the rising edge trigger is crucial to avoid false interrupts. Here, rising edge detection is disabled.

- **Falling Trigger Selection Register (FTSR):**  
  ![FTSR Register](docs/STM_EXTI_FTSR1.png)  
  **Explanation:** The falling edge trigger is enabled so that a low on PB1 (IRQ signal) correctly triggers the interrupt.

- **Pending Register (PR):**  
  ![Pending Register](docs/STM_EXTI_PR1.png)  
  **Explanation:** The pending register indicates when an interrupt has been flagged. It is cleared by writing a '1' to it, which is important for debugging interrupt behavior.

---

### Debugging the Interrupt Issue

- **Pre-Transfer Debug View:**  
  ![Pre-Transfer Debug View](docs/Project_Debug1.png)  
  **Explanation:** Before SPI data transmission, we examine the pending register to ensure no interrupts are flagged inadvertently.

- **During SPI Data Transmission (Transfer Highlight):**  
  ![Transfer Highlight](docs/Project_Debug2.png)  
  **Explanation:** This image shows the code line that sends data over SPI. It is critical to monitor this step, as spurious interrupts during this phase can disrupt communication.

- **Spurious Interrupt Triggered:**  
  ![Spurious Interrupt](docs/Project_Debug3.png)  
  **Explanation:** Captures an unexpected interrupt, likely due to some hardware / crosstalk issue. Oscilloscope confirming no physical low on the IRQ line, however the system registers an interrupt.

- **Disabling EXTI Prior to Transmission:**  
  ![Disabling EXTI](docs/Project_Debug4.png)  
  **Explanation:** To avoid false triggering, we temporarily disable the EXTI interrupt by modifying the IMR register before SPI transmission.

- **IMR Disabled Verification:**  
  ![IMR Disabled](docs/Project_Debug5.png)  
  **Explanation:** Verification that the interrupt mask is disabled. This prevents any unwanted interrupts during data transfer.

- **No Interrupt During SPI Activity:**  
  ![Interrupt Disabled](docs/Project_Debug6.png)  
  **Explanation:** With the interrupt mask disabled, the interrupt is no longer triggered, confirming our workaround.

- **Re-Enabling Interrupt After Transfer:**  
  ![IMR Re-enabled](docs/Project_Debug7.png)  
  **Explanation:** After the SPI transfer, the interrupt mask is re-enabled to restore normal IRQ behavior.

- **Sending a command with Interrupt workaround:**  
  ![General PN532 Trace](docs/PN532_LogicAnalyser.png)  
  **Explanation:** This verifies that we are sending correct PN532 command frames, the interrupt workaround is working. However this never returns an ACK and it was decided to give up on attempting an interrupt. 
> **Note:** Almost certainly the issue with recieving no ACK is due to not enough time being given of SS low before sending the command. The PN532 User Manual stipulates that 1ms be given. Future improvements on this code will likely use interrupts.
